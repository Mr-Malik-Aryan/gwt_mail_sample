# Log of migrating a GWT Mail sample app to Angular2 Dart

## Prepare the project

### Create the Angular Dart project

- create an Anuglar2 Dart project with your usual tooling
- add `angular2_components: ^0.2.2` as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml`

### Add GWT sources

Let's keep two copies of the GWT sources in the project.

The first copy in `gwt/original` will be unchanged.

The second copy in `gwt/backlog` will help us to keep track of the
current backlog of the migration: files and logic that needs to be
processed in one way or another.
